Hello World!

Thanks for visiting.

This is a work in progress.

...

Okay sweet! I got this hooked up properly to Github Pages!.

https://jedpimentel.github.io/The-Amazing-JavaScript-Adventure/

This readme file is fine for text, but I have bigger things in mind.

Next step is to create a blank HTML file. I'll call it index.html

...

Dude! This is starting to shape up.

So, now we have this README.md file, and an index.html file.

The HTML file will be our playground.

... 

Damn, everything is nice and well, but now that I have an HTML file
Updates to this readme won't show up in the website, I guess I'll need
to start writing in the html file instead.

See you there!
