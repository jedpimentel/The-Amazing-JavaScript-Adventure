Hello World!

Thanks for visiting.

This is a work in progress.

...

Okay sweet! I got this hooked up properly to Github Pages!.
https://jedpimentel.github.io/The-Amazing-JavaScript-Adventure/

This readme file is fine for text, but I have bigger things in mind.

Next step is to create a blank HTML file. I'll call it index.html

...

Dude! This is starting to shape up.

So, now we have this README.md file, and an index.html file.

The HTML file will be our playground.
