        <p>Hello world!<p>
        <p>Wow, this is pretty cool<p>
        <p>You know what would be pretty cool too?</p>
        <p>What if this text lines showed up one at a time, as if I were talking right now?</p>
        <p>I mean, you can aready do that by checking the commit history on this repo.</p>
        <p>But that would be waaay too much work. I can't expect people to do all that work.</p>
        <p>Hell, I wouldn't want to do all that work either<p>
        <p>Anyways, yeah, this is going to get out of hand if I just keep working on a giant text wall</p>
        <p>I'm supposed to be making a game, not a book, so let me try this out real quick...</p>
