        <p>Hello there!</p>
        <p>Wow, this is pretty cool</p>
        <p>You know what would be pretty cool too?</p>
        <p>What if these text lines showed up one at a time, as if I were TALKING right now?</p>
        <p>I'm sure someone can go through the whole process of making that happen some day.</p>
        <p>But that would be waaay too much work. I can't expect people to do all that work.</p>
        <p>Hell, I wouldn't want to do all that work either</p>
        <p>Anyways, yeah, this is going to get out of hand if I just keep writing a giant wall of text</p>
        <p>I'm supposed to be making a game, not a book...</p>
