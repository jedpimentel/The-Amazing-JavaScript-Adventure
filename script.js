// THE AMAZING JAVASCRIPT ADVENTURE

// Holy SHIT, this is the SECOND time I move from one file to another
// First from README.md to index.html, now from index.html to script.js
// I sure as hell don't want to kep moving around, so I'll stay here a while

// Okay, so let me print the html body in the console, for debugging pursposes
console.log(document.body)
